### üåê `upstreams.yaml`

- `provider`: `file` or `consul`
- File-based upstreams define:
    - Hostnames and routing paths
    - Backend servers (load-balanced)
    - Optional request headers, specific to this upstream
- Global headers (e.g., CORS) apply to all proxied responses
- Optional authentication (Basic, API Key, JWT)

---

## üí° Example

A sample `upstreams.yaml` entry:

```yaml
provider: "file"
sticky_sessions: false
to_https: false
rate_limit: 10
headers:
  - "Access-Control-Allow-Origin:*"
  - "Access-Control-Allow-Methods:POST, GET, OPTIONS"
  - "Access-Control-Max-Age:86400"
authorization:
  type: "jwt"
  creds: "910517d9-f9a1-48de-8826-dbadacbd84af-cb6f830e-ab16-47ec-9d8f-0090de732774"
myhost.mydomain.com:
  paths:
    "/":
      rate_limit: 20
      to_https: false
      headers:
        - "X-Some-Thing:Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
        - "X-Proxy-From:Hopaaaaaaaaaaaar"
      servers:
        - "127.0.0.1:8000"
        - "127.0.0.2:8000"
    "/foo":
      to_https: true
      headers:
        - "X-Another-Header:Hohohohoho"
      servers:
        - "127.0.0.4:8443"
        - "127.0.0.5:8443"
```

**This means:**

- Sticky sessions are disabled globally. This setting applies to all upstreams. If enabled all requests will be 301 redirected to HTTPS.
- HTTP to HTTPS redirect disabled globally, but can be overridden by `to_https` setting per upstream.
- Requests to each hosted domains will be limited to 10 requests per second per virtualhost.
    - Requests limits are calculated per requester ip plus requested virtualhost.
    - If the requester exceeds the limit it will receive `429 Too Many Requests` error.
    - Optional. Rate limiter will be disabled if the parameter is entirely removed from config.
- Requests to `myhost.mydomain.com/` will be limited to 20 requests per second.
- Requests to `myhost.mydomain.com/` will be proxied to `127.0.0.1` and `127.0.0.2`.
- Plain HTTP to `myhost.mydomain.com/foo` will get 301 redirect to configured TLS port of Aralez.
- Requests to `myhost.mydomain.com/foo` will be proxied to `127.0.0.4` and `127.0.0.5`.
- SSL/TLS for upstreams is detected automatically, no need to set any config parameter.
    - Assuming the `127.0.0.5:8443` is SSL protected. The inner traffic will use TLS.
    - Self-signed certificates are silently accepted.
- Global headers (CORS for this case) will be injected to all upstreams.
- Additional headers will be injected into the request for `myhost.mydomain.com`.
- You can choose any path, deep nested paths are supported, the best match chosen.
- All requests to servers will require JWT token authentication (You can comment out the authorization to disable it),
    - Firs parameter specifies the mechanism of authorisation `jwt`
    - Second is the secret key for validating `jwt` tokens
